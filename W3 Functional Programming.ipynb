    "\n",
    "Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes pure functions, immutable data, and avoiding side effects. Some key concepts in functional programming include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pure functions - Functions that always return the same output for the same input and have no side effects. Their output depends solely on their input arguments.\n",
    "- Immutable data - Data that cannot be modified after it is created. This prevents side effects from functions that mutate data.\n",
    "- Avoid side effects - Calling a function should not modify state outside of the function's scope like mutating a global variable.\n",
    "- First-class functions - Treating functions like any other variable. You can pass them into other functions, return them from functions, assign them to variables, etc.\n",
    "- Higher-order functions - Functions that take in other functions as arguments or return functions as output. This allows abstraction and reusability.\n",
    "- Recursion - Calling a function from within itself to repeat code. This can replace some types of loops.\n",

    "## Activities:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Pure Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure functions are an important concept in functional programming. A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input, and has no side effects. Pure functions only depend on their input arguments - their output is deterministic based solely on their inputs. They do not mutate state, modify global variables, print to screen, access external resources, or have other side effects. The lack of side effects makes pure functions easier to reason about, test, and reuse. Calling a pure function with the same input will invariantly produce the same output. Pure functions are the foundation of functional programming's emphasis on isolation and immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function A\n",
    "def double(x):\n",
    "  x = x * 2 # Mutates input\n",
    "  return x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function B  \n",
    "def double(x):\n",
    "  return x * 2 # No mutation\n",

    "### 2. Immutable Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable data is data that cannot be changed after it is created. In Python, immutable data types include numbers, strings, tuples, and more. Once defined, the value of an immutable object cannot be altered. To \"change\" an immutable object, you must create a new object with the new value. In contrast, mutable data types like lists and dictionaries can be modified in-place after creation. Immutability prevents side effects from functions that alter data. By using only immutable data, a program is easier to reason about as the data cannot change unexpectedly. Immutable data also enables easier sharing across threads without locking as it cannot be mutated. Functional programming emphasizes immutability to reduce side effects and mutation of state.\n",

This means they can be used like any other value in the language - assigned to variables, passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and more. First-class functions are treated like regular values that happen to be callable. This enables higher-order functions - functions that accept other functions as arguments and return functions as output. The ability to manipulate functions as values is essential to functional programming patterns like currying, composition, and pipelines. First-class functions allow passing in different functionality to achieve code reuse and abstraction. Python's support for first-class functions allows developers to adopt a more functional programming style.\n",

    "Higher-order functions are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or return functions as output. They are a key aspect of functional programming, enabling abstraction and reuse. Passing functions to higher-order functions allows parameterising behavior and decoupling logic. Returning functions from higher-order functions allows creating reusable functional code blocks. Python supports higher-order functions, allowing developers to abstract common patterns into reusable higher-order functions that can act on many other functions. This functional technique increases modularity and declarative code. Higher-order functions satisfy the need for looping and iteration in a functional style without mutating state.\n",
