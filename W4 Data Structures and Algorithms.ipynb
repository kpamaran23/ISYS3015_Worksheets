    "# Objective: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to select and use data structures\n",
    "- Develop basic algorithm for a data structure\n",
    "- Understand the basic principles behind mapping services like Google Maps.\n",
    "- Measure and compare algorithms\n",

    "# Task 1 - Understanding Mapping Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Maps is an incredibly sophisticated tool that helps millions of people navigate the world every day. While our exercise today won't capture the entirety of Google Maps' complexity, it'll provide a fundamental understanding of how paths can be determined between two points on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Basic Concepts**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.1. Destinations and Paths**:  \n",
    "Imagine the world is simplified into just a few places. These are our 'destinations'. To move between these destinations, we have 'paths'. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2. Graphs**: \n",
    "This map can be visualized as a graph, where destinations are nodes and paths are edges connecting these nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Simple Map Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a map with 5 destinations and some paths connecting them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A -- B -- C\n",
    "|         |\n",
    "D -- E   |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Representing Our Map In Code**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The map can be stored as a dictionary in Python. Each destination points to its direct neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "graph = {\n",
    "    \"A\": [\"B\", \"D\"],\n",
    "    \"B\": [\"A\", \"C\"],\n",
    "    \"C\": [\"B\", \"E\"],\n",
    "    \"D\": [\"A\", \"E\"],\n",
    "    \"E\": [\"D\", \"C\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Finding the Best Path**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like Google Maps finds the best route for you, we can also determine a path between two destinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our simplified example, we'll use Depth First Search (DFS) to find a path, but note: Google Maps uses much more advanced algorithms to consider factors like traffic, road conditions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Visualizing Our Map**:\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of Python libraries, we can visualize our destinations and the paths between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "Write a Python program that uses the provided graph representation and DFS algorithm to visualize the map and highlight the path between two given points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarities**:\n",
    "- Both this simple model and Google Maps represent locations and paths.\n",
    "- Both aim to find a path between two given points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences**:\n",
    "- Google Maps has millions of destinations and paths, whereas our example only has 5.\n",
    "- Google Maps considers multiple factors like shortest distance, least traffic, and preferred transportation method.\n",
    "- Our method uses DFS, which might not always find the shortest path. Google Maps uses sophisticated algorithms to ensure optimized routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion Questions**:\n",
    "1. How can we improve our simple model to better reflect real-world conditions?\n",
    "2. Why might DFS not always be the best choice for finding paths in a real-world scenario?\n",
    "3. What additional features do tools like Google Maps offer that are not present in our model?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "While our model is a significant simplification, it provides foundational understanding of how mapping tools might determine paths. Mapping tools like Google Maps are built upon these foundational principles but are enhanced with additional features, optimizations, and data sources to serve the needs of users around the world.\n"
